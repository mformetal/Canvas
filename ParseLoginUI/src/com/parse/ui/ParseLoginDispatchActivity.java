/**
 * Activity that starts ParseLoginActivity if the user is not logged in.
 * Otherwise, it starts the subclass-defined target activity.
 * 
 * To use this, you should subclass this activity and implement
 * {@link ParseLoginDispatchActivity#getTargetClass} to return the class of the
 * target activity that should be launched after login succeeds. If the user
 * cancels the login, your app will go back to whatever activity it was on before
 * your subclass dispatch activity was launched, or exit the app if your subclass
 * is the first activity in your app's backstack.
 * 
 * You can think of your subclass as a gate keeper for any activities that
 * require a logged-in user to function. You should have one gate keeper per
 * entry path into your app (e.g. launching the app, or entering through push
 * notifications). When your app launches or receives a push notification, you
 * should specify that your gate keeper activity be launched (and the gate
 * keeper will redirect to your target activity upon successful login).
